# exploding

## Requirements

### Phase 1: Basic Roulette ruse

* There are two players and 47 cards. One of the cards is explosive and the rest are blank.
* All the cards are shuffled and arranged face down in a draw pile.
* Each player, consecutively, draws a card. If the card is blank, it has no effect, and can be discarded; then it is the turn of the other player. If the card is explosive, the player who drew it loses and the other one wins.


### Phase 2: Defuse cards

* We have four additional _Defuse_ cards, making a total of 51 in the deck.
* Game set up:
  1. Give one defuse card to each player.
  2. Put the remaining two defuse cards with the rest in the draw pile, shuffle and arrange face down.
* Each player's turn consists of two steps:
   1. Draw one card
   2. There are three alternatives:
      * Blank card: the turn finishes.
      * Explosive card, if the player has a defuse card: 
        1. Discard the defuse card onto the discard pile.
        2. Return the explosive card to the draw pile.
        3. Re-shuffle the draw pile.
      * Explosive card, if the player does not have a defuse card: She loses, the opponent wins.


### Phase 3: See the future and Skip

* We have two new types of cards: _See the future_ and _Skip_
* The full deck now has:
  * 1 _Explosive_ card
  * 4 _Defuse_ cards
  * 5 _See the future_ cards
  * 4 _Skip_ cards
  * 37 blank cards
* _See the future_ card: allows a player to reveal the top three cards of the draw pile.
* _Skip_ card: allows a player to skip drawing one card from the draw pile.
* The players will start with eight cards in their hand. The number of cards in the hand will vary during the game, without limits.
* Game set up:
  1. Give one defuse card to each player.
  2. Excluding the other defuse cards and the explosive card, give another seven cards to each player, randomly taken from the deck.
  3. Shuffle all the other cards and arrange them face down in a draw pile.
* Each player's turn consists of two steps. Note that drawing happens _at the end_ of the turn.
  1. Play as many cards as wished from the hand, placing them face up on top of the discard pile. The player can continue playing cards until a skip card is used, until she runs out of cards or until she decides so. If a skip card was used, the turn finishes and the next player goes. Otherwise, the turn continues in the step below.
  2. Draw a card. If the card is explosive, a defuse card can be used like in the Phase 2 game, otherwise the player that drew it loses and the other one wins.
